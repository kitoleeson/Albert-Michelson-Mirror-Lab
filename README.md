# Albert-Michelson-Mirror-Lab

This is my simulation of the experiment that Albert Michelson used in 1879 to find the speed of light.

Press SPACE or the "FIRE" button to fire a ball.
Use the sliders to change how many sides the mirror has and the frequency at which it rotates.

Some ways I would improve this in the future:
1. Add sound effects
2. Add ability to change the distance of path
3. Find a better algorithm for when the ball hits a mirror
